This semester I enrolled in a creativity class not thinking too much of it, and boy did it turn out to be an interesting decision. I was somewhat conflicted on the usefulness of the class at first: I wasn't learning anything that I didn't also learn in my Entrepreurship class, but that changed as the semester continued on. 

The class was structured differently than most others; a format I had thought about myself in the past and wanted to see more in classes. Basically I wanted classes where we read the content before hand in class, and then spend time in class discussing the concepts with the class. Minimal lecturing unless the teacher had a great interactive lesson plan or a fascinating story + presentation. While this class wasn't always perfect in it's execution, it was much more engaging than other classes due to this sort of format.

Creativity is a fascinating topic; so fascinating that I decided to take an entire class on it this semester. I'll condense the class down for convienient reading: 

## The Place of Creativity

The two most important skills that have made humans successful beyond any other species in our world are creativity and collaboration. These two are both in opposition and in agreement. It's an interesting balancing act. 

The essesnce of collaboration is the human ability to conform to a culture or soceity. Doing this has allowed humans to have trust in each other, rules, justice and the like. With much greater cooperation abilities than other predators, humans became the apex predator. One guy can't take down a wooly mammoth, nor can ten guys working independently. However ten guys working as a team and being able to yell instructions and communicate are able to. 

This ability however, comes with drawbacks. Creativity is hindered when placed in a conform culture. 




## Brainstorming

Brainstorming is an idea generation method who's concepts can be generalized to almost everything regarding creativity. 

The essential concepts are as follows: 

### Divergent vs. Convergent Thinking

For effective brainstorming, you want to engage in divergent thinking, which means you want to generate as many ideas as possible. Doing this, and building upon the previous ideas gives you a wide variety of ideas and directions to go in. Having options allows you to come up with truely unique solutions. The best and most creative ideas come in the last third of the ideation period. 

Convergent thinking is used to converge onto the most interesting, creative and useful ideas generated. This step is 

### Intersection of Ideas

The most creative ideas come from the combination of multiple fields in novel and interesting ways. Ideas from the paradigm of one field will always be incremental and directional. What you want your ideas to be is intersectional. Intersectional ideas are transcendent. They make advances in many places at once. 

Improving pager technology is directional. Same with improving cell phones. Now combining the two is what has led to the incredible technological revolution and change in soceity. 

## Problem Definition

Properly defining problems is essential to solving them. Nothing is worse than the right answer to the wrong problem.
