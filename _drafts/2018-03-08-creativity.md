This semester I enrolled in a creativity class not thinking too much of it, and boy did it turn out to be an interesting decision. I was somewhat conflicted on the usefulness of the clas at first: I wasn't learning anything that I didn't also learn in my Entrepreurship class, but that changed as the semester continued on.
