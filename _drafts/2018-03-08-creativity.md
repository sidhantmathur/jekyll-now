This semester I enrolled in a creativity class not thinking too much of it, and boy did it turn out to be an interesting decision. I was somewhat conflicted on the usefulness of the class at first: I wasn't learning anything that I didn't also learn in my Entrepreurship class, but that changed as the semester continued on. 

The class was structured differently than most others; a format I had thought about myself in the past and wanted to see more in classes. Basically I wanted classes where we read the content before hand in class, and then spend time in class discussing the concepts with the class.

With much greater cooperation abilities than other predators, humans became the apex predator. One guy can't take down a wooly mammoth, nor can ten guys working independently. However ten guys working as a team and being able to yell instructions and communicate are able to. 

This ability however, comes with drawbacks. Creativity is hindered when
