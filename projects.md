# Business Projects

College coursework and my internship project at Dell. 

### Machine Learning Customer Targeting Tool (Dell)

![Model Accuracy Results](images/roc.PNG)

Microsoft Azure hosted ML tool that receives a customer-list database, runs it through a model, and outputs the likelihood that a customer will buy a certain product. The model's predictions were ~90% accurate and identified an estimated $130 Million in untapped potential customers for the designated product. All details from this project cannot be shared. 

### Marketing Plan (Data Analysis & Visualization)

Marketing plan for local pizzeria. I focused on data analysis, and built an interactive map (cannot be viewed online) that shows the results of survey data by geography, and relates that to the location of the restaurant.
